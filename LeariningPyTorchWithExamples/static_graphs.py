"""
The biggest difference between Tensorflow and Pytorch is TensorFlow's
computational graphs are static but Pytorch's computational grpahs are dynamic

In Tensorflow, we define the computational graph once and then execute the
same graph over and over again.

In Pytorch, each forward pass defines new computational graph.

Static graphs are nice since you can optimize the graph up front(in advance).
For example, a framework might decide to fuse some operations for efficiency,
or to come up with a startegy for distributing the graph across many GPUs or
many machines.

If you are reusing the same graph over and over, then this potentially costly
up-front optimization can be amortized as the same graph is rerun over and over.

With a static graph the loop construct needs to be a part of the graph; for this
reason TensorFlow provides operators such as tf.scan for embedding loops into the graph.

With dynamic graphs the situation is simpler: since we build graphs on-the-fly for each example,
we can use normal imperative flow control to perform computation that differs for each input.

# To contrast with the PyTorch autograd example above, here we use TensorFlow to fit a simple two-layer net:

# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# First we set up the computational graph:

# N is batch size; D_in is input dimension;
# H is hidden dimension; D_out is output dimension.
N, D_in, H, D_out = 64, 1000, 100, 10

# Create placeholders for the input and target data; these will be filled
# with real data when we execute the graph.
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(None, D_in))
y = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(None, D_out))

# Create Variables for the weights and initialize them with random data.
# A TensorFlow Variable persists its value across executions of the graph.
w1 = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal((D_in, H)))
w2 = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal((H, D_out)))

# Forward pass: Compute the predicted y using operations on TensorFlow Tensors.
# Note that this code does not actually perform any numeric operations; it
# merely sets up the computational graph that we will later execute.
h = tf.matmul(x, w1)
h_relu = tf.maximum(h, tf.zeros(1))
y_pred = tf.matmul(h_relu, w2)

# Compute loss using operations on TensorFlow Tensors
loss = tf.reduce_sum((y - y_pred) ** 2.0)

# Compute gradient of the loss with respect to w1 and w2.
grad_w1, grad_w2 = tf.gradients(loss, [w1, w2])

# Update the weights using gradient descent. To actually update the weights
# we need to evaluate new_w1 and new_w2 when executing the graph. Note that
# in TensorFlow the the act of updating the value of the weights is part of
# the computational graph; in PyTorch this happens outside the computational
# graph.
learning_rate = 1e-6
new_w1 = w1.assign(w1 - learning_rate * grad_w1)
new_w2 = w2.assign(w2 - learning_rate * grad_w2)

# actually execute the graph.
with tf.Session() as sess:
  # Run the graph once to initialize the Variables w1 and w2.

  # Create numpy arrays holding the actual data for the inputs x and targets
  # y
  x_value = np.random.randn(N, D_in)
  y_value = np.random.randn(N, D_out)
